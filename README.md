# Neighborhood App

Final project for Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Course.
This is a React app that shows you restaurants around Bela Vista, SP.

You can get more info about a restaurant, clicking on a marker or a list item:
- Address
- Price
- Read

## Demo 

The project demo is available [here](https://neighborhoods-app.herokuapp.com/)

## How to run

To run the project, you need to:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
You can check the project search terms. [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Dependencies

This project uses Google Maps API to show the map. And use Foursquare API to get the list of restaurants and the details of the selected one.
